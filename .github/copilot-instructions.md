This is a React flashcard application built with Vite. The app features:

- Mobile-first design with modern UI elements (blur effects, transparency, rounded edges)
- Tinder-style swiping for flashcard review
- Four difficulty options for card review
- Deck management system
- CSV/TSV import functionality
- Statistics tracking
- Clean, minimal design with color accents

## Guidelines:
- Use vanilla CSS with modern features (CSS variables, modules, media queries)
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use modern JavaScript features (ES6+)
- Avoid TypeScript
- Keep files under 600 lines
